## Features

## Requirements

- [Clawdbot](https://clawd.bot) installed and running locally
- Clawdbot Gateway with HTTP API enabled

## Setup

### 1. Enable the Clawdbot HTTP API

Add this to your `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": {
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The gateway will hot-reload the config automatically.

### 2. Find Your API Token

Your token is in `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` under `gateway.auth.token`:

```bash
cat ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json | grep -A 2 '"auth"' | grep token
```

### 3. Choose Your Connection Method

When you first run a command, Raycast will prompt for your API Endpoint and Token. The endpoint depends on where Clawdbot is running relative to Raycast:

#### Option A: Same Machine (Local)

**Use when:** Raycast and Clawdbot are on the same computer.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| API Endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:18789` |

This is the default - no configuration changes needed on Clawdbot.

---

#### Option B: Local Network (Same WiFi/LAN)

**Use when:** Clawdbot runs on another computer on your home/office network.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| API Endpoint | `http://<clawdbot-machine-ip>:18789` |

**Setup required on the Clawdbot machine:**

1. Find the machine's local IP:
   ```bash
   ipconfig getifaddr en0   # WiFi
   # or
   ipconfig getifaddr en1   # Ethernet
   ```

2. Edit `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` and change the gateway bind setting:
   ```json
   {
     "gateway": {
       "bind": "0.0.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Clawdbot gateway for changes to take effect.

4. Use the local IP as your endpoint, e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:18789`

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the gateway to your entire local network. Risks include:
> - Anyone on the same WiFi can attempt connections
> - Public WiFi = public exposure
> - If port forwarding is enabled on your router, it could be internet-accessible
>
> The token provides some protection, but **Tailscale (Option C) is strongly recommended** for accessing Clawdbot from other machines. Only use this option on trusted private networks.

---

#### Option C: Remote via Tailscale (Recommended for Remote Access)

**Use when:** You want secure access from anywhere - home, office, mobile, etc.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| API Endpoint | `https://<machine-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net` |

**Setup required on the Clawdbot machine:**

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on both machines and sign in to the same account.

2. On the Clawdbot machine, set up Tailscale serve:
   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg 18789
   ```

3. Get your serve URL:
   ```bash
   tailscale serve status
   ```
   Output: `https://machine-name.tailca3a37.ts.net`

4. Use that URL as your API Endpoint.

**Benefits:**
- Encrypted connection (HTTPS)
- Works from anywhere (coffee shop, mobile hotspot, etc.)
- Only accessible to devices on your Tailscale network
- No need to open firewall ports

#### Connection Method Comparison

| Method | Security | Works Remotely | Setup Complexity | Recommended |
|--------|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Local | High (localhost only) | No | None | ✅ Yes |
| Local Network | ⚠️ Low (LAN exposure) | No | Low | Only on trusted networks |
| Tailscale | High (encrypted, private) | Yes | Medium | ✅ Yes - best for remote |

- Troubleshooting tips if connection fails

### Open Webchat
Quickly launch the Clawdbot web UI in your default browser. Opens the same URL configured as your API Endpoint.

## Webchat Setup (Remote Access)

When accessing the Clawdbot web UI from a different machine (via Tailscale or local network), you'll need to complete device pairing.

### Initial Connection

1. Open the webchat URL in your browser (e.g., `https://machine-name.tailca3a37.ts.net`)

2. In the **Gateway Access** section:
   - **WebSocket URL**: Should auto-populate (e.g., `wss://machine-name.tailca3a37.ts.net`)
   - **Gateway Token**: Enter your token from `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` (`gateway.auth.token`)
   - **Default Session Key**: `main` (or your preferred agent)

3. Click **Connect**

### Device Pairing

If you see "disconnected (1008): pairing required", your browser needs to be approved as a trusted device:

**Option A: Approve from the Clawdbot machine**

On the machine running Clawdbot, open the local web UI (`http://127.0.0.1:18789`) and approve the pending device request.

**Option B: Approve via SSH**

Check for pending requests:
```bash
cat ~/.clawdbot/devices/pending.json
```

If there's a pending request, you can approve it by moving it to paired.json (requires generating a token) or restart the gateway and re-initiate pairing from the web UI.

### Verifying Connection

Once connected, the web UI should show:
- **Status**: Connected (green)
- **Health**: Online

## Troubleshooting

### "API error: 405 - Method Not Allowed"
The HTTP API endpoint isn't enabled. Add the config shown in Setup step 1.

### "Failed to connect"
Make sure Clawdbot gateway is running:
```bash
clawdbot gateway status
```

### Token errors
Verify your token matches `gateway.auth.token` in your Clawdbot config.
